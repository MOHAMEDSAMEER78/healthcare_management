### Project Todo: **Node Integration in a Healthcare System**

This design document outlines the architecture for integrating IoT nodes (such as wearables and edge devices), a central edge node server, and cloud servers for managing patient data in a healthcare environment.

---

### **System Overview**
The project involves the deployment of a **three-layer architecture** for handling patient data generated from various edge nodes (e.g., IoT devices and wearables). The system integrates with a **central edge node server** to process anonymized data locally and transmits this data to the **cloud layer** for further processing, storage, or integration with external services.

---

### **Architectural Layers and Concepts**

#### **1. Edge Layer (Decentralized, Closest to the Data Source)**
   - **Edge Nodes**:
     - Each node represents a web server running on IoT devices, wearables, or other edge devices.
     - Devices can include health trackers, mobile apps, or connected medical equipment.
     - **Data Collected**: Raw patient data such as vitals, sensor readings, and health metrics.
     - **Computing Tasks**: Initial processing of raw patient data, which includes capturing and cleaning the data before transmitting it.
     - **API Responsibility**: 
       - **CRUD operations for `PatientData`**: Each edge node creates, reads, updates, and deletes patient data locally.
   
   - **Wearables**:
     - Specialized edge nodes (e.g., fitness trackers, smartwatches) that collect real-time patient health metrics.
     - Transmit patient data back to the central node for further processing.

---

#### **2. Fog Layer (Intermediary, Localized Processing)**
   - **Central Edge Node Server**:
     - This is the **main node server** that acts as a local server for the system, aggregating data from all connected edge nodes (IoT devices, wearables, etc.).
     - **Responsibilities**:
       - **Anonymization**: `AnomizedPatientData` is created at the central node server. Patient identifiers are removed or encrypted to ensure privacy and meet compliance standards.
       - **Data Aggregation**: Consolidates data from various edge nodes, performs additional processing (e.g., data validation, encryption), and prepares it for offloading to the cloud.
     - **API Responsibility**:
       - Anonymizes the collected patient data.
       - Sends `AnomizedPatientData` to the cloud server.
       - Coordinates the communication between individual nodes (IoT devices) and the cloud.

---

#### **3. Cloud Layer (Centralized, High-Processing)**
   - **Cloud Computing**:
     - The cloud server is responsible for handling large-scale processing and long-term storage.
     - **External Integration**: The cloud can connect to external services or APIs to support additional healthcare functions (e.g., predictive analytics, machine learning models, external healthcare systems).
     - **Data Offloading**:
       - Receives `AnomizedPatientData` from the central edge node server.
       - **High Latency**: Due to the remote nature of the cloud, there may be some latency when compared to localized edge nodes.
       - **Containerized Service**: The cloud server can run in a **Docker container** as part of a microservices architecture, allowing easy scaling, deployment, and management.
     - **API Responsibility**:
       - Accepts anonymized patient data from the edge node server.
       - Stores the processed data and integrates with other services for further analysis (e.g., predictive healthcare models, long-term data storage, etc.).

### **APIs Overview**
The system will expose several APIs for handling patient data at different layers of the architecture:

#### **1. CRUD Operations for PatientData (Edge Node Layer)**:
   - **CreatePatientData**: 
     - API to create new patient records from IoT devices, wearables, and other edge devices.
     - Stores raw patient data locally at each node.
   - **ReadPatientData**: 
     - Fetch patient data from the edge nodes.
   - **UpdatePatientData**: 
     - Modify existing patient data at the edge nodes.
   - **DeletePatientData**: 
     - Remove patient data from the edge nodes once it is no longer needed.

#### **2. Anonymized Patient Data (Central Edge Node Server Layer)**:
   - **CreateAnonymizedPatientData**:
     - Collects patient data from multiple edge nodes.
     - Processes and anonymizes the data (removing personally identifiable information).
   - **SendAnonymizedPatientDataToCloud**:
     - Sends the anonymized patient data to the cloud for further processing and long-term storage.

#### **3. Cloud Integration (Cloud Layer)**:
   - **ReceiveAnonymizedPatientData**:
     - Accepts incoming anonymized patient data from the edge node server.
     - Stores the data for further processing or analysis.

### **Data Flow**

1. **Data Collection at Edge Nodes**:
   - Wearables, IoT devices, or edge nodes collect patient data (e.g., vitals).
   - The data is initially stored locally on each edge node.

2. **Anonymization at the Central Edge Node Server**:
   - The central edge node server aggregates data from multiple edge nodes.
   - Anonymization of the patient data occurs here, ensuring compliance with data privacy standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

3. **Offloading to the Cloud**:
   - Once anonymized, the data is sent to the cloud server.
   - The cloud handles further processing (e.g., integration with external services, long-term storage, or running AI models for predictive analytics).

---

### **Security and Privacy Considerations**
- **Data Anonymization**: Patient data must be anonymized at the edge or central edge node to ensure privacy and meet legal regulations.
- **Data Encryption**: All data transmitted between nodes, the central server, and the cloud should be encrypted (e.g., using TLS/SSL).
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Secure access to the API should be enforced, ensuring that only authorized devices can transmit patient data.
- **Compliance**: The system must meet healthcare compliance standards like HIPAA, GDPR, ensuring data privacy and security.

---

### **Advantages of This Architecture**
- **Reduced Latency**: By processing data locally at the edge and central node server, latency is minimized compared to traditional cloud-only systems.
- **Improved Scalability**: The decentralized nature of the architecture enables scalability by adding more edge nodes and allowing the central edge node server to manage local networks.
- **Enhanced Security**: Sensitive patient data is anonymized before being sent to the cloud, reducing the risk of data breaches.
- **Edge-Centric Processing**: Real-time or near-real-time processing is performed closer to the data source (at the edge), improving responsiveness.

### **Next Steps**
1. Define API endpoints for CRUD operations at the edge node level.
2. Implement anonymization logic at the central edge node server.
3. Set up cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure) to receive and process anonymized data.
4. Design the Docker container for the cloud server, ensuring smooth deployment and scaling.
